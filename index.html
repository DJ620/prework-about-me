      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am about to start the UCLA Extension Coding Bootcamp!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in Agoura Hills, California</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I am a musical theatre nerd, I love to act and sing. I also watch way too much television.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>It used to be becoming a Broadway actor, but more recently, my dream job has kind of become unclear. Hopefully through taking this bootcamp, I can say my dream job is becoming a web developer!</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Newbury Park, California</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I've always enjoyed working on computers, and I love how logical coding is. I think being a web developer will be a good fit for me.</p>
